<h1>Dark Tower! The Game</h1>
<p>I believe that this project should qualify for a high grade. The entire map is created using javascript,
as required - and in a rather unique way I would like to believe. Having to make a square map based on 
a circular map was a challenge, but I think it looks pretty good.
</p>

<p>The user makes several impactful choices, outside just playing the game. Entering in how many players,
and selecting the difficulty are the first that everyone will have to play. The difficulty only changes
the amount of brigands in the dark tower (final boss essentially), however the game does change slightly
with one player compared to more.
</p>

<p>To actually play the game, it is mainly designed by the use of clicks on table squares. The one exception
being when the player enters in a number, or Starting their turn in multi-player (That just requires the use
of a click anywhere)
</p>

<p>
The map changes as the players travel around - the picture moves from box to box. A dragon can land and 
block passage through an area, and so on. There are many behind the scene changes as well - such as when 
the dragon lands. After the dragon wreaks havoc on the player, listeners are placed in all the adjacent - 
and viable square - to identify where the player places the dragon. After they do so, these listeners are removed.
</p>

<p>Honestly, the only use of the XMLHttpRequest is what was required in Assignment 6. I was focusing on
finishing the logic and didn't get around to placing a save button (and function) and it's counterpart load.
</p>

<p>As in the original game, there are sound cues abound. I wasn't able to track down all of them, so it 
is an incomplete list. I did then recreate them by recording them - to the best of my limited knowledge
in that field at least. Still, the players will hear sounds as the wander across the landscape.
</p>

<p>
The game logic is about 95% complete. There are a few things that I was not able to get put in - namely
the pegasus. (You can obtain it, just not use it) That and improving some of the random chances. When I
tested it I was either stupidly unlucky or something is a little funky with the random number generator
I used. Like, when fighting Brigands there should be a chance that there are 10 or so less to just over double.
A player is able to beat up to double the amount of Brigands. Yet just about everytime (it would run in streaks,
thus my doubt) I would fight over double and have to retreat (by pressing no). The game feels pretty true
to my memories of playing it though. Was it well designed? No. I planned on designing it in the beginning
with the idea that it was like a text based game. Which made me have to make a lot of weird adjustments. 
So my apologies if you are hoping to figure out why I did some of the things I did. 
</p>

I do code in a very spacious variety, so the number is a little exaggerated, but this project is just shy of 
2000 lines of code. Although 600ish is not game logic. I had a ton of fun doing it. Some other things that I could have tried to do, were using
pictures for more stuff - such when fighting brigands (part of the problem was I didn't plan well on how
to display the menu and information. That and the fact that the map is very large) - Saving/Loading games - the
Pegasus - fixing any other bugs that may be hiding still - and fix some of the timings of stuff. Theoretically,
the score should work, but I never beat the game in testing. (It's a hard game. Get lots of food. Like lots of it)
The higher the Score the better! Oh and I couldv'e tried to improve the quality of the sounds and the like.
</p>

<p>
On a side, more happy note. My brother, who has also played the game, helped me play test it (when it was 
about 80% complete) and found a lot of fun bugs that I got to remove. Like making it so a player could 
get NaN amount of gold.
