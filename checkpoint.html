I had to make several changes, not being used to some of the concepts with javascript and using a web browser.
My game is a turn based game, that is suppose to be played with multiple people, instead of just one.
As such, I'm doing things potentially different than normal. I don't want to have a lot of if statements to determine
if an button can be pressed or not. Instead, I'm going to try to make it so that it places the event
listeners whereever something can be pressed, and it follow the game. I don't have a lot of the options 
designed, but I think I have the design mostly down.
</p>

<p>
One design that I haven't gotten to, but will need to work on, is how I want to show the players inventory
that will show up whenever they want. Mainly for deciding where to place it. Same with the notifications.
For the game notifications I think I will position the menu slightly differently, and have it show up there.
That way the player will see the last message, and not need to press annoying buttons (as it is now)
</p>

<p>Moving should be the hardest part, and tracking what kingdom they are in. I've made it so that they can move
around, so I just need to put in the chances of encountering each of the moving options, and then make it so 
the other buttons work and function properly. Honestly I think Moving, and tracking that is the hardest part.
</p>

Main Components of the logic 
<ul> 
 <li>Handling which buttons are active or not - What a player is able to do, for example
	clicking on the map won't affect being at the Bazaar.</li>
<li>Keeping track of the inventory of the player - which it currently does, but doesn't do anything with it</li>
<li>Identify the events that happen as they traverse around the board - possibilities include</li>
<ol>
<li>Dragon Attack</li>
<li>Cursed</li>
<li>Getting Lost</li>
<li>Plague</li>
</ol>
<li>Entering different buildings - and experiencing all of those</li>
<ol>
<li>Ruins and Tomb</li>
<li>Bazaar</li>
<li>Sanctuary and Citadel</li>
<li>Dark Tower</li>
</ol>
<li>I also need to implement a fighting simulation - albeit a simple one</li>
</ul>
